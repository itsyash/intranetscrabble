intranetscrabble
================

An app for MozillaOS, name-FIREWORD, that basically can be referred to as an INTRANET scrabble game.

We have used Node.js for the real time playing of the game and HTML5 for the layout.

Users can connect to a common server and choose the opponents among the others.For the Dictionary, right now we are using the deafault linux list of words.

As of now, there is only one server and as many players can play simultaeneously on the same board.
And the points are given only on the basis of length of the word.
There's an option of chat also, for the users.

What we plan to do in future:

->Create more than one server, so that there can be something like different rooms for playing the game and the user can
select the room he wants.

->Integrating with the cloud, so as to store user's meta-data on the app,like his favourite servers 
and the pending games. 

->Include the various points features for diffrent positions of the boards and for different alphabets.

->Integrate the facebook data like user's friends on facebook, so that user can invite them to play.
